<p>We don&#8217;t rush and we don&#8217;t watch the clock.</p>
<p>We believe care should flex to your needs, however this should also be simple to understand and easy to keep track of. This is why at BelleVie we tailer our packeages to your specific needs and aspirations and follow a monthly subscription model similar to your broadband or phone bill.

		<h1>About BelleVie</h1>
<p>A world where people who give and receive care and support are valued and thrive together.</p>
<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<ul>
<li>We make life worth living.</li>
<li>We build trusted relationships</li>
<li>We are driven by compassion.</li>
<li>We encourage ambition and creativity.</li>
<li>We strive to be the best we can be by measuring outcomes.</li>
<li>We share accountability and take pride in everything we do.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our Founders</h4>
<p>Bellevie was born at London’s based social impact enterprise accelerator Zinc. Trudie and Violaine are both passionate about creating good jobs in care, to make it a desirable career that will attract top professionals and increase the quality of the service offered to our older population. They have interviewed hundreds of care workers and older people receiving care, and decided to create a new model for homecare that will answer their current concerns and struggles. BelleVie started in Abingdon in partnership with Wellbeing Teams and was joined in January 2020 by Mary Curran.</p>
<h4>Our Inspiration</h4>
<p>We have taken inspiration from Buurtzorg (self-managing teams of nurses in the Netherlands), Wellbeing Teams (self-managing teams in social care in England), and Cornerstone (self-managing teams care and support work in Scotland). We are particularly thankful to Wellbeing Teams for their generosity. They have shared so much with us, including self management techniques, documents and processes.</p>

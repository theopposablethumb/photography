  	<h1>Why I built the solo art curiculum page</h1>
 	 <p>I've been receiving a bit of hate from an anonymous email address (IP is logged at a University in California) for stealing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">RadioRunners Solor Art Curriculum</a> and monetising it. I've since removed the Amazon links, although I didn't make any money from these links and Amazon deactivated them a long time ago becuase I wasn't getting enough traffic. A lot of the resources I linked to have been pirated, and I've found a lot of people in art communities on Discord are circulating pirated links. I really don't judge though, art is hard and art resources can be very expensive.</p>
  	<p>I grew up before the internet was in general public use, and I've been a big advocate of Open Source, Creative Commons, and Remix Culture, which is where I think internet Piracy grew out of. I created the Art Curriculum page out of respect for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">RadioRunners work</a>, but also mainly for myself as I find webpages so much easier to navigate than a flat JPEG file. I published it online only because I thought other people might find it useful, and I was surprised at the amount of traffic it was receiving from across the world. I really didn't expect it to be found so easily and become so popular, and I genuinely hope that people have found RadioRunners work as helpful as I have.</p>
 	 <p>I've always made great pains to make sure this work is attributed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">RadioRunner, the original author</a>, in the spirit of Creative Commons and sharing information in a more accessible form on the internet. I very much put a credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">RadioRunner</a> at the top of the page and at the bottom in the footer too, and I've never claimed to have authored this work. I just wanted to make it a bit more accessible for myself and potentially others.</p>
 	 <p>Adding affiliate Amazon links was, I admit, an error in judgement. I did this as an experiment to see if I could learn something for another idea I had. I was also unemployed at the time. I really didn't mean any disrespect to the original author or the art community, and I apologise if I have caused any. As it happens this experiment failed big time. I didn't make a single cent / penny, and Amazon deactivated the links. I left them where they were out of lazyness but also in case anyone found them useful. I shouldn't have posted them in the first place. I'm sorry.</p>  
 	 <p>I wanted to apologise for any disrespect or hurt I've caused. I've adjusted this page in response to the (very aggressive) feedback I've received, and I admit I made a mistake. Hopefully this comes close to rectifying it. If <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">RadioRunner</a> wants me to take this page down, then please just ask and I'll take it down and use it privately. <a href="https://www.brendanmeachen.com/contact">Likewise if anyone has any other feedback, I'm very happy to listen.</a> Please let me know, and please be nice and include a real email address so I can ask for more detail if I need to. I promise to be nice and do what I can to make things right.</p>
 	 <p>Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone deserves to be held accountable for thier actions. Everyone also deserves a little bit of respect and being nice will create the open dialogue we so desperately need in these divisive times.</p>
 	 <p>Huge respect and thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/dapk62/from_the_guy_who_made_the_most_comprehensive_list/">RadioRunner</a> for putting this information together in the first place and sharing it with the wider community. You are a legend.</p>
 	 <p>Big thanks to the anonymous person who called me out and sent me feedback. It wasn't a nice email, but I appreciate you taking the time and I hear you. I hope this rectifies the situation but please let me know it it doesn't.</p>
 	 <p>Peace and love, - <em>Bren</em></p>

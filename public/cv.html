        <h2>Employment History</h2>
        <h3>UX Designer, Front End Developer – BelleVieCare.co.uk - September 2020 – Current</h3>
        <p>BelleVieCare are a start-up business reinventing social care, and introducing self-management principles to remotely distributed teams of carers. </p>
        <p>I was asked to join the team as a Business Analyst to research and develop a strategy for a time scheduling system for self-managing teams of careers, typically users with a low exposure to digital products in late middle-age.  The system is required to replace a complicated Google Sheet supported by complex Python functions, which is prone to manual error and often breaks due to user input.</p>
        <p>I conducted several user and stakeholder interviews, and collated my findings into a set of process maps and proposed user journeys which I used to product requirements. Since BelleVie is a small start-up I took the opportunity to develop user persona’s and design a UI in Sketch, which I presented in regular show and tell sessions and individually to potential users. Feedback was then incorporated into interactive prototypes which I developed using ReactJS, which I then took into formal user testing.</p>
        <p>BelleVie soon recruited a full development team, with a full product roadmap and backlog informed by my research and testing. As a collaborative team we have gone on to develop a working Minimum Lovable Product in 3 months which is currently in a live trial with a Care Team. As a team we are continuously iterating and learning, however initial results have shown a small increase in time efficiency within the team.</p>
        <p>I have also supported BelleVie analysing and simplifying manual and complex back-office processes for payroll, invoicing, and recruitment. </p>
        <h4>Key achievements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>User interviews with carers regarding their day to day routines, processes, and existing tooling, identifying pain-points and opportunities for improvement and efficiency.</li>
          <li>Mapping of current business processes and definition of target business process, and presentation to all stakeholders</li>
          <li>Creation of a Product Roadmap for new tooling, prioritising a custom scheduling system, and authoring of a prioritised backlog of user stories.</li>
          <li>Definition of MVP and MLP (Minimum Loveable Product) based on user research and process analysis</li>
          <li>Design of UX flows and UI screens in Sketch, and interactive prototypes in ReactJS, in collaboration with real users and stakeholders.</li>

          <li>Initial definition of an eCommerce platform proposal and creation of a clickable prototype for a funding application to North Star Ventures, the application was successful and funding was approved</li>
          <li>Facilitation of user testing for proposed solutions, ensuring product development is iteratively guided by user feedback</li>
          <li>Introduction of agile ceremonies, including regular business wide show and tells, which has since been adopted by the wider leadership for all projects.</li>
          <li>Successful delivery of an MVP built on AWS using Serverless, ReactJS, and GraphQL</li>
          <li>Analysis of existing manual back-office processes and opportunities for automation and improvement. Approx. £10k annual revenue savings and an increase in customer satisfaction</li>

        <h3>Technical Product Owner – Contract - Virgin Media - April 2020 – October 2020</h3>
        <p>I joined Virgin Media as a Technical Product Owner to support the development of new Digital Care and Support journeys. Working in a very waterfall environment I was asked to support a poorly performing team and pivot ways of working to Agile delivery. I implemented agile ceremonies and coached Senior Stakeholders on agile ways of working, setting expectations for delivery of new features. I authored a Product Roadmap, mapping product features to technical capabilities in collaboration with the technical teams and vendors. I presented weekly Show and Tell sessions to Chief Digital Officer.</p>

        <h3>Digital Consultant - Contract - Hutchison 3G UK - April 2019 – February 2020</h3>
        <p>After taking a year sabbatical to go travelling I was invited back to Three as a consultant working on three.co.uk. I was asked to join an underperforming scrum team and oversee delivery of a flagship product on legacy systems. Working in an ambiguous and unstructured environment, the project required coordination between multiple vendors and a new strategic partner based in London.
          As a we enabled a successful high-profile product launch, designing and delivering a complex web journey from ideation to full production solution for a hard deadline. I worked with senior stakeholders to define a clear product and technical roadmap for ongoing iterative optimisation of the customer journey, utilising qualitative and quantitative data.
          I also defined and agreed release processes for multiple online systems, to address an overall lack of governance and control within the organisation. This led to a decrease in unplanned incidents on three.co.uk, and an increase in quality of released products.</p>                       
        <h4>Key achievements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Facilitated various workshops to shape the product roadmap and define the product backlog, including epics and user stories</li>
          <li>Formed a wider team across Three, a technical vendor, and UKBroadband to encourage greater collaboration towards aligned business goals</li>

          <li>Regular coaching to various teams within Digital on Roadmap planning, release planning, and product definition</li>
          <li>Worked with Data Protection and Information Security for two organisations, to ensure all technical solutions are secure and GDPR compliant</li>
        </ul>

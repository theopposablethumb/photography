				<h1>Double Chocolate Chip Awesome! Cookies!</h1>
				<p>This website uses Google Analytics to track performance and visitors. All information is anonymised, all I see is general information about where people may be browsing from (assuming you're not using a VPN), and the kind of device and software they are using to browse my website.</p>
                <p>I also get to see which external websites people navigate to my site from, or whether they navigate to my domain directly. I can then see which pages they navigate to.  All analytics does is give me an idea of which photographs or content people are interested in, and which browsers / platforms my website needs to support.</p>
                <p>Since this is a non-commercial website, which I use purely to promote my creative work, all of this analytics information is for me a curiosity. I'm not selling anything on this website, and I won't ask anyone to sign up to anything to access a free eBook or PDF or some other content.</p>
                <p>That's it! I only use Google Analytics, nothing more. No Multi-Variate testing, or retargeting, or nasty data collection on behalf of shadowy third-parties. Google presumably collect their own date through analytics, but if you use google to search, or use google chrome, or have an android phone, then presumably google knows more about you than you yourself do.</p>
